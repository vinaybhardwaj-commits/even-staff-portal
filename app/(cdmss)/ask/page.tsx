        body="Even CDMSS is a clinical decision-support system: it takes your clinical question, searches a curated database of textbooks, references, and primary research, and returns a synthesized answer with verifiable citations to every claim. The value over a quick web search is that the answer is grounded in evidence we control, and a second model audits the draft for unsupported claims, missing caveats, and clinical errors before you see it. The limits to know: it does not replace clinical judgment, and citations should still be verified for high-stakes decisions."
